## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Local or Atlas URI)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Go Tickets
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with your MongoDB connection string:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gotickets
PORT=5000
```
*(Replace the URI with your MongoDB Atlas connection string if using cloud database)*

Start the backend server:
```bash
node index.js
# OR if you have nodemon installed
npm run dev
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory, and install dependencies:
```bash
# If you are in the server directory, go back one level
cd .. 
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in terminal).
